PHP Markdown Lib 1.6.0 - 23 Dec 2015

by Michel Fortin  
<https://michelf.ca/>

based on Markdown by John Gruber  
<https://daringfireball.net/>


Introduction
------------

This is a library package that includes the PHP Markdown parser and its 
sibling PHP Markdown Extra with additional features.

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown
allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text
format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

"Markdown" is actually two things: a plain text markup syntax, and a 
software tool, originally written in Perl, that converts the plain text 
markup to HTML. PHP Markdown is a port to PHP of the original Markdown 
program by John Gruber.

Requirement
-----------

This library package requires PHP 5.3 or later.

Note: The older plugin/library hybrid package for PHP Markdown and
PHP Markdown Extra is still maintained and will work with PHP 4.0.5 and later.

Before PHP 5.3.7, pcre.backtrack_limit defaults to 100 000, which is too small
in many situations. You might need to set it to higher values. Later PHP 
releases defaults to 1 000 000, which is usually fine.
